These discs are interesting in some way for emulator behavior testing.

- glitch.ssd
Test cases that hammer CRTC / ULA registers and may even look pretty.

- mode7-75.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/126
By Kieran Connell.
Messes with CRTC R9 in MODE 7.

- mode7-bug.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/141
By Kieran Connell.
Triggers interesting MODE 7 character states.

- Music2.ssd
From http://mdfs.net/Mirror/Image/JGH/Music2.ssd
The Doctor Who song playback displays MODE 8.

- PLAY_DISC.ssd, SAVE_DISC.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/198
Disc for drives 0 / 1 for Dragonsoft Explorer.
Dragonsoft Explorer requires sideways RAM and has a custom disc loading
routine that issue unusual i8271 commands directly.
Also seems to do timing / video tricks.

- raster-c.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
Excellent test case of Hitachi CRTC corner cases.

- teletest_v1.ssd
Various teletext tests.
Includes the famous Teletext engineering test page.
And a test by me that tests additional things.

- upside-doom.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
CRTC test case that uses a multiple frames per horizontal line, and illustrates
the CRTC quirk of "no display on last horizontal character".

- upside-doom-no-skew.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
As above but uses a strange skew trick to avoid the problem of "no display on
last horizontal character".
